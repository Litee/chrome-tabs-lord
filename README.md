Chrome browser extension for using vertical tabs IN ADDITION to existing horisonal tabs. Should be useful if you have large number of tabs. Inspired by Sidewise extension, which has closed source code.

# Key features so far:
- Sidebar with tree view of windows and tabs
- Possible to close and re-order tabs via sidebar
- Possible to quickly move tabs to specific windows via context menu
- Windows may have custom names - useful for quickly sending tabs to specific window

# Status

** Currently in alpha status, extension is published as private in Chrome Web Store. **

I am using it for myself to identify issues. If you want to play with extension - let me know your Google e-mail so I can add you to the list of testers.

# TODOs

- Allow to hibernate tabs manually and with timeout. Exclusions should be supported. Maybe different treatment of tabs that have not been used for a very long time.
- Highlight duplicate tabs
